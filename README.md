Campaign for selling personal loans


This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) which has a growing customer base. Majority of these
customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying size of deposits. The number of customers
who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this
base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on
loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to
personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year
for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the
retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success
ratio with minimal budget.


The department wants to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have
higher probability of purchasing the loan. This will increase the success ratio while at the same time
reduce the cost of the campaign.


The file Bank.xls contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic
information (age, income, etc.), the customer&#39;s relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities
account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). Among
these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the
earlier campaign.
